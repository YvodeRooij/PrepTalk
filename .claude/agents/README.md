# PrepTalk Subagents - Team Guide

This directory contains 7 specialized AI subagents designed to help PrepTalk reach Release Candidate (RC) status. Each agent has a focused role based on 2025 industry best practices for multi-agent systems.

## Quick Start

### Invoking Subagents

You can invoke subagents directly from Claude Code:

```
@tester Please write E2E tests for the curriculum generation flow

@system-architect Should we use Redis or Upstash for caching?

@coder Implement background job processing for curriculum generation

@code-reviewer Review the changes in lib/providers/llm-provider-service.ts

@security-reviewer Audit the API routes for authentication vulnerabilities

@tech-lead What are the critical blockers for RC? Create an action plan.

@ux-reviewer Review the dashboard page for usability issues
```

## The Team

### 1. üß™ Tester (`tester.md`)

- Checking test coverage
- Running performance benchmarks

**Tools**: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep

**Example**:
```
@tester Write E2E test to verify that:

3. Curriculum preview/edit page
4. Dashboard display

Check for:
- Clear feedback during long wait
- Error handling UX
- Mobile responsiveness
- Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA)
```

## Multi-Agent Workflows

### Feature Development
```
@tech-lead ‚Üí @system-architect ‚Üí @coder ‚Üí @tester ‚Üí @code-reviewer ‚Üí @security-reviewer
```

### Bug Fix
```
@tester ‚Üí @tech-lead ‚Üí @coder ‚Üí @tester ‚Üí @code-reviewer
```

### Architecture Decision

## Best Practices

### 1. Use the Right Agent for the Task
Don't ask the Coder to make architecture decisions - that's the System Architect's role.

### 2. Provide Context
Give agents relevant information:
- File paths
- Error messages
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Related PRs/issues

### 3. Be Specific
‚ùå Bad: "@coder fix the bug"
‚úÖ Good: "@coder Fix the 503 timeout issue in llm-provider-service.ts line 250"

### 4. Coordinate Complex Tasks
For large features, start with Tech Lead to create a plan, then delegate to specialists.

### 5. Verify Results
Always check agent output:
- Run tests after code changes
- Review architectural recommendations
- Validate security fixes
