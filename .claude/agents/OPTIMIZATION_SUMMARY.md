# Subagent Optimization Summary

## ✅ Critical Issues Fixed

Based on official Claude Code documentation analysis, we identified and fixed 4 critical issues:

### 1. ✅ Model Format Corrected
**Problem**: Used specific version strings instead of official model names
```yaml
# ❌ Before
model: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929

# ✅ After
model: sonnet  # or opus
```

**Impact**: Ensures proper model selection and compatibility with Claude Code

### 2. ✅ MultiEdit Tool Added
**Problem**: Coder and Tester lacked MultiEdit for efficient batch editing
```yaml
# ❌ Before (Coder)
tools: [Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep]

# ✅ After (Coder)
tools: [Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit, Bash, Glob, Grep]
```

**Impact**: Enables efficient multi-file edits (renaming, refactoring)

### 3. ✅ Tech Lead Tool Bloat Reduced
**Problem**: Tech Lead had 7 tools, doing too much hands-on work
```yaml
# ❌ Before
tools: [Read, Write, Bash, Glob, Grep, Task, WebSearch]

# ✅ After
tools: [Read, Glob, Grep, Task, WebSearch]
```

**Removed**: Write, Bash (should delegate to Coder, not implement)

**Impact**: Forces proper delegation, clearer separation of concerns

### 4. ✅ Optimized Tool Combinations
**Aligned with official patterns**:
- **Read-only analysis**: Code Reviewer, UX Reviewer (Read, Glob, Grep)
- **Code modification**: Coder, Tester (Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit)
- **Research**: System Architect, Security Reviewer (Read, Glob, Grep, WebSearch)

## 🎯 Model Selection Strategy

Following user directive: **"Mostly use Sonnet and Opus, Haiku only when model really doesn't matter"**

### Opus (Complex Reasoning) - 3 agents
- **System Architect** 🏗️: Architecture decisions, design patterns, scalability
- **Security Reviewer** 🔒: Security is critical, zero tolerance for errors
- **Tech Lead** 👔: Strategic coordination, technical decisions

### Sonnet (Balanced Performance) - 4 agents
- **Coder** 💻: Feature implementation, bug fixes
- **Code Reviewer** 👀: Quality assessment, best practices
- **Tester** 🧪: Test design, validation, E2E testing
- **UX Reviewer** 🎨: Usability analysis, accessibility

### Haiku (Fast/Simple) - 0 agents
*Not used - per user directive, only use when model really doesn't matter*

**Rationale**: All our agents require reasoning, judgment, or complex analysis. Even test execution needs understanding of test design and failure analysis.

## 📊 Optimized Agent Matrix

| Agent | Model | Tools | Primary Role | Use When |
|-------|-------|-------|--------------|----------|
| **Tester** | Sonnet | 7 tools + MultiEdit | E2E tests, TDD, quality | Need tests written or verified |
| **System Architect** | Opus | 5 tools | Design, scalability | Architecture decisions needed |
| **Coder** | Sonnet | 7 tools + MultiEdit | Implementation | Features, bugs, refactoring |
| **Code Reviewer** | Sonnet | 3 tools (read-only) | Quality review | PR review, quality check |
| **Security Reviewer** | Opus | 4 tools | Security audit | Security concerns, auth review |
| **Tech Lead** | Opus | 5 tools (no Write/Bash) | Coordination | Planning, delegation, decisions |
| **UX Reviewer** | Sonnet | 4 tools | UX/accessibility | Interface review, usability |

## 🔧 Tool Philosophy

**Read-Only Reviewers** (3 tools):
- Code Reviewer: No ability to modify, just analyze
- Enforces "review don't fix" pattern

**Research Agents** (4-5 tools):
- System Architect, Security Reviewer, UX Reviewer
- Can search web, analyze code, but not modify
- WebSearch for staying current with best practices

**Implementation Agents** (7 tools):
- Coder, Tester
- Full access: Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit, Bash, Glob, Grep
- Can modify code and run tests

**Coordination Agent** (5 tools):
- Tech Lead has Task tool for delegation
- No Write/Bash - must delegate to Coder
- Forces proper team coordination

## 🚀 Performance & Cost Impact

### Model Cost Comparison
- **Opus**: ~$15 per 1M input tokens (highest quality)
- **Sonnet**: ~$3 per 1M input tokens (best value)
- **Haiku**: ~$0.25 per 1M input tokens (fastest)

### Our Strategy
**Critical reasoning (Opus)**: 3/7 agents = 43% of team
- System Architect, Security Reviewer, Tech Lead
- High cost but essential for complex decisions

**Balanced work (Sonnet)**: 4/7 agents = 57% of team
- Coder, Code Reviewer, Tester, UX Reviewer
- Optimal quality/cost ratio for implementation

**Cost estimate**: ~60% of "all Opus" cost, with 100% quality where it matters

## 📈 Best Practices Applied

### From Official Claude Docs:
1. ✅ **Correct model format** (`sonnet`, `opus`, not version strings)
2. ✅ **Tool minimalism** (only what's needed for the role)
3. ✅ **Clear, specific descriptions** (what agent does, when to use)
4. ✅ **Specialized prompts** (focused on specific domain)
5. ✅ **YAML frontmatter** (proper metadata format)

### From 2025 Multi-Agent Research:
1. ✅ **Single responsibility** (each agent has one clear role)
2. ✅ **Heterogeneous roles** (Planner, Coder, Reviewer pattern)
3. ✅ **Clear boundaries** (read-only vs modification agents)
4. ✅ **Parallelization support** (independent agents can work concurrently)

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Complex Architecture Decision
```bash
# Use Opus-powered System Architect
@system-architect Should we use Redis or Upstash for caching?
Consider: cost, latency, serverless compatibility, maintenance
```

### Security Audit
```bash
# Use Opus-powered Security Reviewer
@security-reviewer Audit lib/agents/curriculum/nodes/persistence.ts
Check: RLS policies, input validation, secrets exposure
```

### Feature Implementation
```bash
# Step 1: Plan (Opus)
@tech-lead Create plan for background job processing

# Step 2: Design (Opus)
@system-architect Design job queue architecture

# Step 3: Implement (Sonnet)
@coder Implement based on approved design

# Step 4: Test (Sonnet)
@tester Write E2E tests for job processing

# Step 5: Review (Sonnet)
@code-reviewer Review implementation
```

### Quick Code Review
```bash
# Use Sonnet (fast, accurate)
@code-reviewer Review lib/providers/llm-provider-service.ts
Focus: error handling, type safety, performance
```

## 🔍 Verification

Run this to verify all agents are correctly configured:
```bash
for file in /workspaces/PrepTalk/.claude/subagents/*.md; do
  echo "=== $(basename $file) ==="
  grep -A 10 "^---" "$file" | head -12
done
```

Expected output:
- All models are `sonnet` or `opus` (no version strings)
- Coder and Tester have `MultiEdit`
- Tech Lead has no `Write` or `Bash`
- Code Reviewer has only 3 read-only tools

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Test with real tasks** - Verify agents work as expected
2. **Document patterns** - Create common workflow examples
3. **Monitor costs** - Track Opus vs Sonnet usage
4. **Iterate** - Adjust based on real-world usage

## ✨ Summary

**Fixed**:
- ✅ Model format (sonnet/opus)
- ✅ Added MultiEdit to implementation agents
- ✅ Reduced Tech Lead tools (removed Write/Bash)
- ✅ Optimized tool combinations per role

**Strategy**:

- Production-ready multi-agent system
- Follows official Claude Code best practices
- Optimized cost/performance balance
- Clear separation of concerns
- Ready for RC development!
