# Duplicate Reverse Questions - Root Cause & Solution

## Problem Statement

**Initial Report:** Reverse interview questions were duplicating across multiple interview rounds

**Example from Production:**
```
Behavioral Round: "With Mistral AI's commitment to open-source AI models..."
Culture Round:    "With Mistral AI's commitment to open-source AI models..."
Strategic Round:  "With Mistral AI's commitment to open-source AI models..."
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Initial Hypothesis (WRONG ❌)
We thought the problem was **round-based CI assignment** - Strategic Round was getting 87.5% of CI facts, leaving other rounds with too few facts.

### RCA Discovery (RIGHT ✅)
The real problem wasn't WHO gets WHICH facts.

**The problem was: All rounds used the SAME APPROACH to the SAME facts.**

Example: "Series B funding ($415M)" generated these questions:

| Round | Question (Old Approach) | Problem |
|-------|------------------------|---------|
| Recruiter | "balance pressure to scale quickly while maintaining culture" | Same angle |
| Behavioral | "balance pressure to scale quickly while maintaining quality" | Same angle |
| Culture | "balance moving fast" | Same angle |
| Strategic | "balance pressure to rapidly expand" | Same angle |
| Executive | "balance pressure to accelerate growth" | Same angle |

**All 5 questions ask the same thing: "How do you balance scaling pressure?"**

### Key Insight

**For a Strategic Account Executive role, 87.5% of CI facts ARE genuinely strategic.**

The golden dataset EXPECTED Strategic to get 7/8 facts:
- Series B funding? Strategic ✓
- Open-source differentiation? Strategic ✓
- Azure partnership? Strategic ✓
- GDPR advantage? Strategic ✓
- Platform launch? Strategic ✓
- Developer community? Strategic ✓
- Efficiency focus? Strategic ✓

**The model wasn't wrong - it was correctly identifying strategic facts!**

## Solution: Angle-Based Question Generation

### Core Principle

**Don't assign DIFFERENT facts to rounds.**
**Instead, allow ALL rounds to use ALL facts, but with DIFFERENT ANGLES.**

### Implementation

Created `angle-based-reverse-questions-prompt.ts` with 5 distinct angles:

| Round | Angle | Description | Example (Series B funding) |
|-------|-------|-------------|---------------------------|
| Recruiter | Career Impact | Personal career growth | "what new career growth paths are becoming available" |
| Behavioral | Team Process | How teams work together | "how does the sales team coordinate to manage increased volume" |
| Culture | Values Manifestation | How values show up in action | "how the team has kept core values during scaling" |
| Strategic | Competitive Positioning | Market differentiation | "how would you leverage our $2B valuation against OpenAI" |
| Executive | Industry Vision | 3-5 year market evolution | "how do you envision the competitive landscape evolving" |

### Results

**Test: Same CI fact (Series B funding) used in 4 rounds**

✅ **Angle-Based (DIFFERENT questions):**
- Recruiter: Career paths opening up
- Behavioral: Team coordination during scaling
- Culture: Maintaining values during growth
- Executive: Industry competitive dynamics

❌ **Old Approach (DUPLICATE questions):**
- All 5 rounds: "How do you balance scaling pressure?"

**Metric Validation:**
- Angle-Based: 3.13x average fact reuse
- Old Approach: 2.78x average fact reuse
- **Higher reuse WITHOUT duplication** ✅

## Implementation Status

### Files Modified

1. **`lib/agents/curriculum/prompts/angle-based-reverse-questions-prompt.ts`** (NEW)
   - Contains 5 angle definitions with examples
   - Explicit forbidden angles for each round
   - Few-shot examples showing same fact, different angles

2. **`lib/agents/curriculum/nodes/persona-generation.ts`** (MODIFIED)
   - Line 873: Import `buildAngleBasedReverseQuestionPrompt` instead of `buildReverseQuestionPrompt`
   - Line 884: Call angle-based prompt builder

### Test Files

1. **`test-angle-based-deduplication.ts`**
   - Generates 25 questions per approach (5 rounds × 5 questions)
   - Compares fact usage and duplication
   - Validates angle differentiation

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Design angle-based system** - COMPLETED
2. ✅ **Test with real curriculum** - COMPLETED (3.13x reuse, no duplication)
3. ✅ **Integrate into persona-generation.ts** - COMPLETED
4. ⏳ **Generate full curriculum to validate end-to-end**
5. ⏳ **Measure semantic similarity reduction**
6. ⏳ **Multi-industry validation**

## Key Learnings

1. **Optimizing for metrics ≠ Solving the problem**
   - Achieved 91% accuracy on golden dataset
   - But Strategic still got 87.5% of facts
   - This matched golden dataset expectations!
   - **Real problem was question angle, not fact assignment**

2. **Same input, different perspectives**
   - One CI fact can generate 5 unique questions
   - Key is enforcing ANGLE differentiation
   - Not about WHO gets WHAT, but HOW they use it

3. **Prompt engineering > Complex categorization**
   - Initially built LLM-based CI categorization (34s latency)
   - Realized we didn't need it at all
   - Angle-based prompt solves the problem more simply

## Comparison: Old vs New Approach

### Old Approach (Round-Based CI Assignment)
```
1. Categorize CI facts by round (34s LLM call)
2. Strategic gets 7/8 facts (correct!)
3. Each round generates questions from its assigned facts
4. Problem: Same angle across all questions
5. Result: "How does [fact] help you scale?" × 7 questions
```

### New Approach (Angle-Based Generation)
```
1. No categorization needed (0s)
2. All rounds see all facts
3. Each round has a REQUIRED angle + FORBIDDEN angles
4. LLM generates questions following the angle
5. Result: Same fact, 5 different angles, 0 duplicates
```

## Evidence of Success

From `test-angle-based-deduplication.ts`:

**La Plateforme fact (used 5x in angle-based):**

| Round | Question | Angle |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Recruiter | "how might this create fresh opportunities to expand" | Career Impact ✓ |
| Behavioral | "how do sales, product, and engineering teams collaborate" | Team Process ✓ |
| Culture | "how has the team culture adapted during this transition" | Values ✓ |
| Strategic | "as a competitive tool when pitching to enterprises" | Competitive ✓ |
| Executive | "how do you see the AI platform economy evolving" | Industry Vision ✓ |

**All 5 questions are CLEARLY different.**
